                <p>(WORK IN PROGRESS) For this project, I was interested in making a site that would serve as my digital diary/archive for
                    songs. i merged inspirations from RPG video games as well as Spotify Wrapped.i've always enjoyed
                    organizing the music I listen to within
                    playlists as a method of creative curation.

                    Rather than making a sterile archive of data, I hope to imbue aspects of my design taste and songs
                    that I love into the site.


                </p>
                <p>check out the original playlist!</p>
